1.00
Original version.  Includes Taylor Matlab Toolbox v1.06.





1.00->1.01  (August 31, 2011)
Updated to use TMT v1.10.





1.01->1.02  (September 7, 2011)

Made each trace have its own timeline.  This will be useful
for, for example, looking at optical and electrical signals at the
same time, since those often have very different sampling rates.  Also
added the ability to load data from a .tcs file.





1.02->1.03  (never completed)

Plan is to add ability to calculate coherency, cohereograms, and TFs.
This will require some way to select two traces that is asymmetric, in
that one signal will be the test, and one the reference, signal.
Think I will add a visual indication of the last signal selected.
Aborted this one.  Doing coherences, etc. with different sampling
rates is a royal pain, and I think not worth the effort.





1.01->1.04  (September 9, 2011)

Reverting to 1.01, starting from there.  Dealing with calculating
cross-power spectra from signals on different time bases is a pain in
the ass at best.  Also, it's arguably a bad idea, because then the user
has to wonder about how the resampling is done.

Changed selections so that selected axes are indicated by a
boldface axis label.  I hope this makes it more apparent that the axes
are the things selected, not a particular stretch of the data.

Changed selections so that the most-recently-selected axes (which I
call the "pivot") is indicated visually, but italicizing the axis
label.  This also creates an asymmetry in the selection when two axes
are selected, which enables the input and output signals to be
specified when calculating coherency and TFs.

Fixed a bug with selections.  Have to keep track of complete sequence
of selection, so that the pivot one can change back to the previous
one when you ctrl-select the pivot.

Added ability to calculate coherency, cohereograms, and TFs.

Added ability to set arbitrary y ranges on axes, and optimize the y
ranges just on the selected axes.





1.04->1.05 (September 13, 2011)

Added the ability to read .tcs files.  This involves upsampling of
signals to a common time base in some cases, which is warned about.

Also changed the code that does resampling to the pixel grid, to
eliminate use of blkproc(), which is deprecated.  Re-coded in JIT-able
Matlab.  Is now ~2x faster.

 



1.05->1.06 (September 20, 2011)

Refactored the code so that there is a Groundswell_main class which
implements the main Groundswell window.  This let me move the
groundswell progam state into this object, and out of the figure,
axes, etc. userdata fields.  This was always one the biggest
weirdnesses with GUI programming in Matlab.

Fixed bug where debugging messages about the resampling method went to
the command window.

Fixed bug where Groundswell_main.get_spectrogram_params() and
Groundswell_main.get_spectrogram_params() didn't return enough args if
user hit 'Cancel' or there was a problem with the params.

Changed what Groundswell_main methods I could to static class methods.

Fixed bug where errordlg() would sometimes cause the main figure
contents to shrink.

Made it so y axis labels all line up w/ each other.

Deleted leading spaces from names & units on data load.





1.06 -> 1.07  (September 21, 2011)

Refactored code into some approximation of the MVC style.  I think
this will make it easier to think about and maintain going forward.

Put the test code into the groundswell directory, so that I can
distribute the test code with the code proper.

First code checked into Janelia internal Subversion repository.

As with all versions since 1.01, groundswell 1.07 relies upon the 
Taylor Matlab Toolbox, version 1.10.
